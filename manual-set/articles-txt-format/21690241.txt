The poly-γ-D-glutamic acid capsule of Bacillus anthracis enhances lethal toxin activity.

The poly-γ-D-glutamic acid (PGA) capsule is one of the major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis, which causes a highly lethal infectious disease. 
The PGA capsule disguises B. anthracis from immune surveillance and allows its unimpeded growth in the host. 
The PGA capsule recently was reported to be associated with lethal toxin (LT) in the blood of experimentally infected animals (M. 
H. 
Cho, et al., Infect. 
Immun. 78:387-392, 2010). 
The effect of PGA, either alone or in combination with LT, on macrophages, which play an important role in the progression of anthrax disease, has not been thoroughly investigated. 
In this study, we investigated the effect of PGA on LT cytotoxicity using the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1. 
PGA produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of the cytotoxicity of LT on J774A.1 cells through an enhancement in the binding and accumulation of protective antigen to its receptors. 
The increase of LT activity was confirmed using Western blot analysis, which showed that the combination of PGA and LT produced a greater degree of degradation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases and an increased level of the activation of the proform of caspase-1 to its processed form compared to the effects of LT alone. 
In addition, mice that received a tail vein injection of both PGA and LT had a significantly increased rate of death compared to that of mice injected with LT alone. 
PGA had no effect when added to cultures or administered to mice in the absence of LT. 
These results emphasize the importance of PGA in the pathogenesis of anthrax infection.
