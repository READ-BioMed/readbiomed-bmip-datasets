Literature review of the epidemiology of influenza B disease in 15 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

Influenza control strategies focus on the use of trivalent influenza vaccines containing two influenza A virus subtypes and one of the two circulating influenza type B lineages (Yamagata or Victoria). 
Mismatches between the vaccine B lineage and the circulating lineage have been regularly documented in many countries, including those in the Asia-Pacific region. 
We conducted a literature review with the aim of understanding the relative circulation of influenza B viruses in Asia-Pacific countries. 
PubMed and Western Pacific Region Index Medicus were searched for relevant articles on influenza type B published since 1990 in English language for 15 Asia-Pacific countries. 
Gray literature was also accessed. 
From 4834 articles identified, 121 full-text articles were analyzed. 
Influenza was reported as an important cause of morbidity in the Asia-Pacific region, affecting all age groups. 
In all 15 countries, influenza B was identified and associated with between 0% and 92% of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in any one season/year. 
Influenza type B appeared to cause more illness in children aged between 1 and 10Â years than in other age groups. 
Epidemiological data for the two circulating influenza type B lineages remain limited in several countries in the Asia-Pacific, although the co-circulation of both lineages was seen in countries where strain surveillance data were available. 
Mismatches between circulating B lineages and vaccine strains were observed in all countries with available data. 
The data suggest that a shift from trivalent to quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines could provide additional benefits by providing broader protection.
