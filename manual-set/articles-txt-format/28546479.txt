Complete Genome Sequence of an Avian H1N1 Influenza Virus Strain Isolated from Migratory Birds in the Republic of Korea.

Here, we report the complete genome sequence of an H1N1 avian influenza virus (AIV), which was isolated from the feces of migratory birds in the Republic of Korea during the winters of 2014 and 2015. 
Full-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all genome segments belonged to the Eurasian lineage.
