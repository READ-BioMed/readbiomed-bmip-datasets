Humoral and cellular immune responses to influenza vaccine in patients with advanced cirrhosis.

Influenza vaccine has been shown to successfully reduce influenza- and pneumonia-associated hospitalizations and deaths. 
Yet in liver cirrhosis, influenza vaccines have received little attention in determining the potential benefits. 
Thus, we undertook this study to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses to vaccination against influenza in patients with advanced cirrhosis. 
We measured interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion response and hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) of antibody titer from pre- and post-vaccination blood samples in 80 cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh class B or C) and 80 healthy, age-matched subjects. 
Although the patients with advanced cirrhosis showed similar humoral immune response against influenza vaccination compared to the healthy controls, cell-mediated immunity showed different results according to the remnant liver function.
