A comparative study of the adjuvanticity of Hansenula polymorpha, Saccharomyces cerevsiae and Yarrowia lipolytica in oral and nasal immunization with virus capsid antigens.

The adjuvanticity of Hansenula polymorpha, Saccharomyces cerevsiae and Yarrowia lipolytica were compared for oral and nasal immunization with virus capsid antigens. 
Mice were immunized orally with human papillomavirus type 16 L1 virus-like particles (HPV16 L1 VLPs), or intra-nasally with formalin-inactivated influenza A virus (FIV), in combination with one or other yeast. 
Mice receiving HPV16 L1 VLPs combined with H. polymorpha had a significantly higher titer for serum anti-HPV16 L1 IgG and neutralizing activity than those receiving HPV16 L1 VLPs combined with either of the other two yeasts. 
Also, mice receiving FIV combined with H. polymorpha had not only a markedly higher anti-influenza A virus IgG titer but also a higher survival rate after a potentially lethal influenza A virus challenge. 
We suggest that H. polymorpha thus will be useful for enhancing immune responses in mucosal immunizations.
