Protective effect of dietary xylitol on influenza A virus infection.

Xylitol has been used as a substitute for sugar to prevent cavity-causing bacteria, and most studies have focused on its benefits in dental care. 
Meanwhile, the constituents of red ginseng (RG) are known to be effective in ameliorating the symptoms of influenza virus infection when they are administered orally for 14 days. 
In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary xylitol on influenza A virus infection (H1N1). 
We designed regimens containing various fractions of RG (RGs: whole extract, water soluble fraction, saponin and polysaccharide) and xylitol, and combination of xylitol with the RG fractions. 
Mice received the various combinations orally for 5 days prior to lethal influenza A virus infection. 
Almost all the mice died post challenge when xylitol or RGs were administered separately. 
Survival was markedly enhanced when xylitol was administered along with RGs, pointing to a synergistic effect. 
The effect of xylitol plus RG fractions increased with increasing dose of xylitol. 
Moreover, dietary xylitol along with the RG water soluble fraction significantly reduced lung virus titers after infection. 
Therefore, we suggest that dietary xylitol is effective in ameliorating influenza-induced symptoms when it is administered with RG fractions, and this protective effect of xylitol should be considered in relation to other diseases.
