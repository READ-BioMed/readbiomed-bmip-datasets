Rapid acquisition of polymorphic virulence markers during adaptation of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus in the mouse.

Emergence of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus in Asia and its spread to Europe and North America has caused great concern for human health. 
Although the H5N8 virus has been only moderately pathogenic to mammalian hosts, virulence can still increase. 
We evaluated the pathogenic potential of several H5N8 strains via the mouse-adaptation method. 
Two H5N8 viruses were sequentially passaged in BALB/c mice and plaque-purified from lung samples. 
The viruses rapidly obtained high virulence (MLD<sub>50</sub>, up to 0.5 log10â€‰PFU/mL) within 5 passages. 
Sequence analysis revealed the acquisition of several virulence markers, including the novel marker P708S in PB1 gene. 
Combinations of markers synergistically enhanced viral replication and polymerase activity in human cell lines and virulence and multiorgan dissemination in mice. 
These results suggest that H5N8 viruses can rapidly acquire virulence markers in mammalian hosts; thus, rapid spread as well as repeated viral introduction into the hosts may significantly increase the risk of human infection and elevate pandemic potential.
