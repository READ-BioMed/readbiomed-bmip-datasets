Three-dimensional CT might be a potential evaluation modality in correction of asymmetrical masseter muscle hypertrophy by botulinum toxin injection.

For correction of this asymmetrical hypertrophy, botulinum toxin type A (BTxA) injection is one of convenient treatment modalities. 
Unfortunately, physical examination of masseter muscle is not enough to estimate the exact volume of muscle hypertrophy difference. 
Two Koreans, male and female, of bilateral masseter hypertrophy with asymmetricity were evaluated. 
BTxA (NABOTA(Â®), Daewoong, Co. 
Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was injected at master muscle site with total 50 U (25 U at each side) and volume change was evaluated with three-dimensional (3D) CT image analysis. 
Maximum reduction of masseter hypertrophy was recognized at 2-month follow-up and reduced muscle size started to restore after 3 months. 
Mean reduction of masseter muscle volume was 36% compared with baseline. 
More hypertrophied side of masseter muscle presented 42% of volume reduction at 2-month follow-up but less hypertrophied side of masseter muscle showed 30% of volume shrinkage. 
In conclusion, 3D CT image analysis might be the exact evaluation tool for correction of asymmetrical masseter hypertrophy by botulinum toxin injection.
