# Pathogens data set

This data set has been generated for the annotation of pathogens from the scientific literature using the [readbiomed-ncbi-pathogen-dataset-generation](https://github.com/READ-BioMed/readbiomed-ncbi-pathogen-dataset-generation)
package.

## NCBI taxonomy pathogen data set (ncbi folder)

National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data sources have been used to automatically collect information about pathogens from NCBI database resources. The

This includes data about taxonomic pathogens (e.g. bacteria and viruses) and as well PrPSc prions and toxins.

The information for each pathogen is in XML format and includes meta-data about the pathogen, information about subspecies and PubMed and PubMed Central identifiers that can be used to recover information about these pathogens from the scientific literature.

## Manually annotated data set (manual-set folder)

The manual-set folder contains manual annotation for the characterisation of actively research pathogens from the scientific literature.

More information about the manually annotated data set are available [here](./manual-set).
